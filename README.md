## Overview

Nedara Monitoring is an open-source web application that collects metrics from your infrastructure over SSH and direct database connections and displays them on a live dashboard. It is built with Flask + Flask-SocketIO on the backend and lightweight, dependency-free frontend code.

## Features

- **Multi-environment support** — switch between environments (production, staging, …) from the UI; each environment has its own collection thread and independent chart history
- **Linux server monitoring** (via SSH)
  - CPU, RAM, and disk utilization with progress bars and color coding
  - Load average (1-minute)
  - Network throughput (MB/s receive / transmit)
  - Disk I/O (MB/s read / write)
  - Running processes sorted by CPU/RAM, with colored badges
  - Nginx HTTP request rate (optional, requires access to nginx access log)
  - Application log tailing with syntax highlighting (optional)
- **PostgreSQL monitoring** (via psycopg)
  - Active and idle-in-transaction query list with wait times
  - Database size
  - Per-database filtering
  - Critical query highlighting (> 10 s)
- **PGBouncer monitoring** (via psycopg admin interface)
  - Pool statistics: active/waiting clients, active/idle servers, requests/s, max wait, avg query time
  - Per-pool breakdown table
- **Web application health check** — HTTP status + response time for a configured URL
- **Real-time charts** (LightweightCharts by TradingView) — CPU, RAM, Load Average, HTTP Requests, Network, Disk I/O
  - Historical data persisted in SQLite and reloaded on page load
  - Pause/Resume per chart
  - Fullscreen expand for each chart and panel
- **Theme** — Auto / Light / Dark, respects OS preference, persists across sessions
- **Email notifications** via SMTP
  - Sent when a server, PostgreSQL, or web application becomes unreachable
  - Maximum one email per 15 minutes per incident (throttle)
  - Per-environment toggle — disable alerts on staging while keeping them on production
  - Configurable alert delay — wait N minutes before sending, to avoid alerts for transient outages
  - Mail indicator in the UI when email notifications are configured
- **Web admin interface** at `/admin` — configure the application from the browser without touching `config.ini`
  - Password-protected (Werkzeug password hash stored in `config.ini`)
  - First-time setup wizard: set the password directly in the browser on first access
  - Can be disabled entirely by setting `admin_enabled = 0`

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- The monitored Linux servers must be reachable over SSH with password or key authentication
- The PostgreSQL user used for monitoring needs read access to `pg_stat_activity` and `pg_database`
- The PGBouncer user must be listed in `admin_users` in `pgbouncer.ini`

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nedara-Project/nedara-monitoring.git
cd nedara-monitoring
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

> The `--recursive` flag is required to fetch the `nedarajs` UI library submodule (`static/js/lib/nedarajs`).

### 2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure the application

```bash
cp config.ini.example config.ini
```

Edit `config.ini` to match your infrastructure (see [Configuration](#configuration) below).

### 4. Run

```bash
python3 app.py
```

The dashboard is available at `http://localhost:5000` (or whatever port you set in `[general]`).

**Optional — Gunicorn (recommended for production):**

Gunicorn is not required but provides better stability under load. If you choose to use it:

```bash
pip install gunicorn eventlet
gunicorn --worker-class eventlet -w 1 app:app -b 0.0.0.0:5000
```

> Use exactly **1 worker** — Flask-SocketIO requires a single worker process. Use `eventlet` or `gevent` as the worker class.

## Production Deployment

### systemd service

**With Gunicorn (recommended):**

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Nedara Monitoring
After=network.target

[Service]
User=youruser
WorkingDirectory=/opt/nedara-monitoring
ExecStart=/opt/nedara-monitoring/.venv/bin/gunicorn --worker-class eventlet -w 1 app:app -b 127.0.0.1:5000
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
SyslogIdentifier=nedara-monitoring

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Without Gunicorn (python3 only):**

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Nedara Monitoring
After=network.target

[Service]
User=youruser
WorkingDirectory=/opt/nedara-monitoring
ExecStart=/opt/nedara-monitoring/.venv/bin/python3 app.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
SyslogIdentifier=nedara-monitoring

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now nedara-monitoring
```

### Nginx reverse proxy (optional)

> The `Upgrade` / `Connection` headers are required in all configurations for WebSocket (Socket.IO) to work through Nginx.

**HTTP only:**

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name monitoring.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

**HTTPS with SSL (recommended for production):**

Obtain a certificate first, e.g. with Let's Encrypt:

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d monitoring.yourdomain.com
```

Or place your own certificate files and use the following configuration:

```nginx
# Redirect HTTP → HTTPS
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name monitoring.yourdomain.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

# HTTPS
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name monitoring.yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/monitoring.yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/monitoring.yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

    ssl_protocols       TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers         HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_session_cache   shared:SSL:10m;
    ssl_session_timeout 10m;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

> If you use self-signed certificates, `verify = False` is already the default for the web health check in `check_web_status`. For Let's Encrypt or a trusted CA, you can remove that bypass in `app.py`.

## Configuration

The application is configured via `config.ini`. Copy `config.ini.example` as a starting point.
Alternatively, enable the [Admin interface](#admin-interface) to configure everything from the browser.

### `[general]`

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `port` | Port the app listens on (default: `5000`) |
| `display_name` | Title shown in the browser tab and dashboard header |
| `refresh_rate` | Seconds between metric collection cycles (default: `1`) |
| `chart_history` | Number of data points kept per chart series (default: `5000`) |
| `chart_adaptive_display` | `1` = fit chart to visible points; `0` = show all history (default: `1`) |
| `debug` | Flask debug mode — **set to `0` in production** |
| `secret_key` | Flask session secret — use a long random string |
| `admin_enabled` | `1` to enable the `/admin` interface, `0` to disable it (default: `0`) |
| `admin_password` | Werkzeug password hash (see [Admin interface](#admin-interface)) |
| `email_notif_smtp_server` | SMTP host for alert emails |
| `email_notif_smtp_port` | SMTP port (e.g. `587` for STARTTLS) |
| `email_notif_login` | SMTP username |
| `email_notif_password` | SMTP password |
| `email_notif_recipients` | Comma-separated list of recipient addresses |

### `[environments]`

```ini
[environments]
available_env = staging, production
default_env = production
```

### Environment sections

```ini
[production]
url = https://your-app.com        ; URL checked for web application health
url_name = My App                 ; display label (optional)
servers = app1, db1, pgb1         ; comma-separated list of server section names
send_emails = 1                   ; set to 0 to disable all alerts for this environment
alert_delay_minutes = 0           ; wait N minutes before sending (0 = immediate)
```

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `url` | URL to health-check (HTTP GET, status 200 = healthy) |
| `url_name` | Display label shown next to the health indicator |
| `servers` | Comma-separated list of server section names to monitor |
| `send_emails` | `1` to send alerts (default), `0` to disable — useful for staging environments |
| `alert_delay_minutes` | Minutes to wait before sending an alert email. If the issue resolves within the delay window, no email is sent. `0` = send immediately. |

### Server types

#### `type = linux` — Linux server (SSH)

```ini
[app1]
type = linux
name = App Server                 ; display name in the dashboard
host = 192.168.1.10               ; SSH host
user = deploy                     ; SSH username
password = secret                 ; SSH password
log_file = /var/log/myapp/app.log ; optional: path to tail for the Logs button
nginx_access_file = /var/log/nginx/access.log  ; optional: enables HTTP requests chart
chart_label = App Server          ; label shown in charts (must be unique per environment)
chart_color = #3b82f6             ; line color in charts (hex)
```

> **SSH user requirements**: the user needs read access to `/proc/loadavg`, `/proc/net/dev`, `/proc/diskstats`, `/proc/meminfo`, and the ability to run `top`, `df`, `ps`. If `log_file` or `nginx_access_file` are set, the user also needs read access to those files.

#### `type = postgres` — PostgreSQL database

```ini
[db1]
type = postgres
name = PostgreSQL
host = 192.168.1.20
port = 5432
user = monitor_user
password = secret
database = mydb                   ; primary database (used for size reporting)
```

> **PostgreSQL user requirements**: the user needs the `pg_monitor` role (or equivalent `SELECT` on `pg_stat_activity`) and `CONNECT` on the target database.
>
> ```sql
> CREATE USER monitor_user WITH PASSWORD 'secret';
> GRANT pg_monitor TO monitor_user;
> GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE mydb TO monitor_user;
> ```

#### `type = pgbouncer` — PGBouncer connection pooler

```ini
[pgb1]
type = pgbouncer
name = PGBouncer
host = 192.168.1.20
port = 6432                       ; PGBouncer listen port (default: 6432)
database = pgbouncer              ; always "pgbouncer" (the admin virtual database)
user = postgres                   ; must be listed in admin_users in pgbouncer.ini
password = secret
```

> **PGBouncer requirements**: the connecting user must be listed in `admin_users` inside `/etc/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.ini`:
> ```ini
> admin_users = postgres
> ```
> After editing, reload: `sudo systemctl reload pgbouncer`
>
> Test the connection manually:
> ```bash
> psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6432 -U postgres pgbouncer -c "SHOW POOLS;"
> ```

## Admin interface

The `/admin` page lets you configure the application from the browser without editing `config.ini` manually.

### Enabling the admin interface

Set `admin_enabled = 1` in `config.ini` and restart. The interface is disabled by default.

### Setting the admin password

**Option A — First-time setup (browser)**

Leave `admin_password` empty in `config.ini`. On your first visit to `/admin`, you will be prompted to set a password. The hash is then saved automatically.

**Option B — CLI hash generation**

Generate a hash and paste it directly into `config.ini`:

```bash
python3 -c "from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash; print(generate_password_hash('yourpassword'))"
```

Then set:

```ini
[general]
admin_enabled = 1
admin_password = scrypt:32768:8:1$...   ; paste the full hash here
```

### What the admin panel covers

| Tab | Settings |
|-----|----------|
| **General** | Display name, refresh rate, chart history, adaptive display, debug mode |
| **Email** | SMTP server/port/login/password/recipients + per-environment `send_emails` toggle and `alert_delay_minutes` |
| **Servers** | Host, credentials, chart labels/colors, log file paths for each configured server |
| **Admin** | Enable/disable the interface, change the admin password |

> Adding or removing environments and servers still requires editing `config.ini` and restarting. The admin panel covers settings that can change at runtime.

### Disabling the admin interface

Set `admin_enabled = 0` (or remove the key). `/admin` will return a `403` immediately without revealing whether an admin exists.

## Security

- Keep `config.ini` out of version control — it contains SSH and database credentials. Add it to `.gitignore`.
- Create dedicated read-only users for monitoring (see requirements for each server type above).
- Use a strong, random `secret_key`.
- In production, run behind Nginx with TLS and restrict access to trusted IPs.
- The admin interface is protected by a Werkzeug password hash. Never share or expose the hash directly.
